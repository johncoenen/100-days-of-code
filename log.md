**Today's Progress**: 
  Build ASP.NET Core Angular application from tutorial
**Thoughts** 
  - It's a miracle this works at all, but I will call this a win
  - The tutorial was well written and I only had a few workarounds and bugs to deal with
  - First time getting an Angular app running with Visual Studio 2017
  - Will be continuing this tutorial tomorrow and adding enhancments

### Wednesday, January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
  Added developer-friendly enhancements to ASP.NET Core Angular app
**Thoughts** 
  - Proxy API calls to the ASP.NET Core Server using ng serve command
    -- this watches for changes to the code, transpiles the code, and reserves the code to localhost:4200 by default
  - Enabled automatic re-compilation for ASP.NET Core
    -- enables the ability to make changes to (server-side)code and show live changes in the already running Angular app
  - In order to run both applications in watch mode:
    -- First run: dotnet watch run (command)
    -- Then run: ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json(command in another terminal)
    -- Then browse to localhost:4200(default) to see live changes made to app

### Thursday, January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
  - Begin Angular Tutorial: Tour of Heroes
  - complete steps 1 - 4 of tutorial
    -- This app is data-driven and will enable the user to:
      1. display a list of hero names
      2. edit selected hero's details
      3. navigate through different views of the hero's data
    - Created the application shell which consists of a html, css, and typescript file
      - created initial structure using Angular CLI
      - learned Angular components display data
      - used double curly braces syntax to display the app title
    - Created the Hero Editor
      - used the CLI to create a second HeroesComponent
      - displayed the HeroesComponent by adding it to the AppComponent shell.
      - applied the UppercasePipe to format the name
      - used two-way data binding with the ngModel directive
      - learned about the AppModule
      - imported the FormsModule in the AppModule so that Angular would recognize and apply the ngModel directive
      - learned the importance of declaring components in the AppModule  
    - Created a display for Hereos List
      - The Tour of Heroes app displays a list of heroes in a Master/Detail view.
      - The user can select a hero and see that hero's details.
      - used *ngFor to display a list
      - used *ngIf to conditionally include or exclude a block of HTML
      - learned to toggle a CSS style class with a class binding

### Saturday, January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
  - (cont.)Angular Tour of Heros
    - Created a separate, reusable HeroDetailComponent
    - Used property binding
      - this gives the parent HeroesComponent control over the child HeroDetailComponent
    - Used the @Input decorator
      - this makes the hero property available for binding by the external HeroesComponent
  
**Thoughts** 
  - After this post I am going to begin implementing some small changes to the daily log format
    - These are my notes for the areas that will remain/change:
      - Keep timestamp for day, date, year
        - add time spent per day using time tracking app
      - (maybe) change Thoughts area to include more information on the days lesson
        - more blog-like, where I will take the most important detail of the day and expand on the terminology 
      - Add another category where tech detail links can be added 

### Monday, January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
  - (cont.)Angular Tour of Heros
    - Dipped into Angular Dependency Injection 
    - added get data method to HeroService which is an asynchronous signature
    - Used Observable and the RxJs Observable libray
    - Used RxJs of() to return Observable of mock heroes ( Observable<Hero[]> )
    - The component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook calls the HeroService method, not the constructor.
    - You created a MessageService for loosely-coupled communication between classes.
    - The HeroService injected into a component is created with another injected service, MessageService.

**Thoughts** 
  - still have to implement some changes in this structre, may wait til next project
  - 1:01 - time spent on Services portion of this 
  - This is one of the more important sections of the Tutorial. I am going to go back to the beginning
    and write down the important areas of interest, up to this point, as a personal reference
